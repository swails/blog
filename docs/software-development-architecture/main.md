# The Anatomy of a Successful Software Engineering Capability

[Software is eating the world.](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/) Published in 2011, this prediction has shown real staying power. Many companies benefit greatly by writing their own software, even in industries that traditionally contracted their software. For example, by writing their own software, [Tesla was in a better position to respond to chip shortages than its competitors by adapting the software to available hardware.](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/tesla-chip-semiconductor-shortage/628150/) By being able to deploy bespoke software solutions, companies can customize their software to meet their needs more precisely than what is available with strictly off-the-shelf offerings.

While the promise of managing their own software development capability may sound convincing, it is easier to run a software engineering function poorly than well. The better a software engineering capability is run, the more quantifiable value is added by that capability. For instance, the number of additional vehicles Tesla was able to manufacture and sell by adapting to available chips is one measure of added value. The faster it was able to adapt its software, the more additional vehicles (and therefore added value) it would realize.

The purpose of this article is to describe what I think is the best way to organize and structure a software engineering capability to maximize the value added by the capability. I will not discuss best practices in actually *writing* software (I may return to that in a later article), but rather how to deploy and configure code development tools in a way that provides a foundation for sustainable and scalable software development.

## What does it mean to have sustainable software development?

A sustainable software engineering capability is one that is able to continuously deliver added value as time goes on at a consistent pace. Unfortunately, to inexperienced software engineers identifying unsustainable practices may happen long after said practices are already adopted.

The early stages of development of new software are easy to show rapid progress. A *new* software project starts with no features, no bugs, no users, and very frequently few developers. Under such ideal conditions, churning out new code and features is fast, fun, and exciting. The software remains fairly simple, and therefore easily conceptualized in its entirety by the small team of developers that worked to start it.

As a successful project matures its number of features and bugs grows alongside the size of its user base and development team. It is at this stage that many poorly-run software engineering functions encounter problems. Poor software engineering practices can make teamwork challenging and inefficient, leading to a sharp decline in pace of delivering features and fixing (or even identifying) bugs.

A sustainable software engineering function does not suffer from these inefficiencies. They can onboard new team members and enable them to start contributing quickly. Identifying and fixing bugs is streamlined as much as possible, resulting in software that is more robust and reliable.

## Designing Sustainable Software Engineering
